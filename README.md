## Advantages of using this library
Normally, you can only calculate numbers on a 64-bit OS as long as the final result is less than 18,446,744,073,709,551,616. (4,294,967,296 for a 32-bit OS.)

With this library, you can calculate numbers as long as the final numbers is less than the above number long, not just that number.

## What coding languages does this library support?
For now, it only support JavaScipt. I have plans to eventually port it to Python.
