# BigNumberCalculator

## About

This is a library that let's numbers be calculated up to:

  64 bit OS: 2^64-1 digits LONG 
  
  32 bit OS: 2^32-1 digits LONG

Want to see this library in action? Just go [here](github.com)!

## Advantages of using this library
Normally, you can only calculate numbers on a 64-bit OS as long as the final result is less than 18,446,744,073,709,551,616. (4,294,967,296 for a 32-bit OS.)

With this library, you can calculate numbers as long as the final numbers is less than the above number(s) long, not just that(those) number(s).

## What coding languages does this library support?
For now, it only support JavaScipt. I have plans to eventually port it to Python, then Java, and then C#.
